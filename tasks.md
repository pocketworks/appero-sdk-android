## Core SDK Features (Based on iOS Version)

### 1. SDK Initialization & Configuration
- [x] **Implement SDK initialization with API key and client ID**
  - Create `Appero.instance.start(apiKey: String, clientId: String)` method
  - Set up singleton pattern for global access (similar to iOS shared instance model)
  - Initialize core SDK components and networking
  - Store credentials securely for API calls to https://app.appero.co.uk/api/feedback
  - **Android-specific**: Initialize in Application.onCreate() or MainActivity.onCreate()

### 2. User Experience Tracking System
- [x] **Implement experience points tracking with Likert scale**
  - Create `Experience` enum: `VERY_POSITIVE(+2), POSITIVE(+1), NEUTRAL(0), NEGATIVE(-1), VERY_NEGATIVE(-2)`
  - Create `log(experience: Experience)` method with predefined scoring (same as iOS)
  - Create `log(points: Int)` method for custom scoring (developer-defined scale)
  - Maintain running total of user experience points
  - Store experience data persistently (SharedPreferences)
  - **Key insight**: Track positive/negative interactions to build experience score

- [x] **Implement smart prompting threshold system**
  - Add `ratingThreshold` property (configurable, default: 5 points based on iOS pattern)
  - Add `shouldShowAppero` property to check if prompt should be displayed
  - Logic: only prompt when experience score crosses threshold AND user hasn't already given feedback

  - If rating < threshold, show a thank you message as the second step
  - Use Google Play In-App Review API for review prompt
  - The rating threshold for review prompt should be configurable by the developer (not hardcoded)
  - Ensure this flow is the second step after the feedback prompt, matching iOS UX
  - Provide clear API for customizing this behavior
  - Document the flow and configuration in README

## What Appero Does (Context)
Appero is an intelligent in-app feedback widget that drives organic growth by:
1. **Tracking user experience** - Monitors positive/negative interactions in your app using a points system
2. **Smart prompting** - Only asks for feedback when users have had enough positive experiences (crosses threshold)
3. **Collecting feedback** - Provides a native UI for users to rate (1-5 stars) and provide written feedback
4. **Driving growth** - Converts happy users into app store reviews and referrals
5. **Preventing feedback fatigue** - Tracks who has already given feedback to avoid re-prompting

The key insight is that instead of randomly prompting users for feedback (which often gets negative responses), Appero waits until users have demonstrated they're having a good experience before asking for their opinion.
