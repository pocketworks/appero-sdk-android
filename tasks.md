## Core SDK Features (Based on iOS Version)

### 1. SDK Initialization & Configuration
- [x] **Implement SDK initialization with API key and client ID**
  - Create `Appero.instance.start(apiKey: String, clientId: String)` method
  - Set up singleton pattern for global access (similar to iOS shared instance model)
  - Initialize core SDK components and networking
  - Store credentials securely for API calls to https://app.appero.co.uk/api/feedback
  - **Android-specific**: Initialize in Application.onCreate() or MainActivity.onCreate()

### 2. User Experience Tracking System
- [ ] **Implement experience points tracking with Likert scale**
  - Create `Experience` enum: `VERY_POSITIVE(+2), POSITIVE(+1), NEUTRAL(0), NEGATIVE(-1), VERY_NEGATIVE(-2)`
  - Create `log(experience: Experience)` method with predefined scoring (same as iOS)
  - Create `log(points: Int)` method for custom scoring (developer-defined scale)
  - Maintain running total of user experience points
  - Store experience data persistently (SharedPreferences)
  - **Key insight**: Track positive/negative interactions to build experience score

- [ ] **Implement smart prompting threshold system**
  - Add `ratingThreshold` property (configurable, default: 5 points based on iOS pattern)
  - Add `shouldShowAppero` property to check if prompt should be displayed
  - Logic: only prompt when experience score crosses threshold AND user hasn't already given feedback
  - **Android-specific**: Consider Activity lifecycle for prompt timing

### 3. User Session Management
- [ ] **Implement user ID management with persistence**
  - Auto-generate unique user ID on first use (UUID, stored in SharedPreferences)
  - Add `setUser(userId: String)` method for account-based systems
  - Add `resetUser()` method to clear user data on logout
  - Track feedback submission status per user ID
  - **Important**: Experience score and feedback status are tied to user ID

### 4. Feedback Collection API
- [ ] **Implement feedback submission with networking (Retrofit)**
  - Create `postFeedback(rating: Int, feedback: String)` suspend function
  - API endpoint: POST https://app.appero.co.uk/api/feedback
  - Form data: api_key, client_id, rating, feedback, sent_at (ISO 8601)
  - Use Retrofit with OkHttp for HTTP requests
  - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
  - Mark user as having submitted feedback to prevent re-prompting
  - **Flutter consideration**: Design API to be easily wrapped for Flutter plugin

### 5. UI Components (Android Native - Jetpack Compose Priority)

  - Create `ApperoTheme` data class/interface
  - Provide default system theme (follows system light/dark mode)
  - Provide fixed light and dark themes (like iOS version)
  - Allow custom color schemes for branding
  - Apply theme to all UI components
  - Add `Appero.instance.theme = customTheme` property
  - **Android-specific**: Integrate with Material Design 3 theming

### 7. Analytics Integration

  - Clear current experience points
  - Reset feedback submission status
  - **Caution**: Should be used carefully, recommend tracking last prompt date

- [ ] **Add configuration options**
  - Customizable prompt timing and cooldown periods
  - Minimum experience threshold settings
  - Debug logging options
  - **Android-specific**: Consider app lifecycle and background restrictions

### 9. UI Integration Patterns
- [ ] **Jetpack Compose Integration**

  - Mock network requests (MockWebServer)
  - Test user session management
  - Test experience tracking logic
  - **Android-specific**: Use JUnit, Mockito, and Android Test frameworks

- [ ] **Create sample implementations**
  - Jetpack Compose sample app (modern Android)
  - Traditional View system sample app (legacy support)

  - Design callback interfaces that can be bridged to Flutter
  - **Future task**: Create separate Flutter plugin that wraps this Android library

## What Appero Does (Context)
Appero is an intelligent in-app feedback widget that drives organic growth by:
1. **Tracking user experience** - Monitors positive/negative interactions in your app using a points system
2. **Smart prompting** - Only asks for feedback when users have had enough positive experiences (crosses threshold)
3. **Collecting feedback** - Provides a native UI for users to rate (1-5 stars) and provide written feedback
4. **Driving growth** - Converts happy users into app store reviews and referrals
5. **Preventing feedback fatigue** - Tracks who has already given feedback to avoid re-prompting

The key insight is that instead of randomly prompting users for feedback (which often gets negative responses), Appero waits until users have demonstrated they're having a good experience before asking for their opinion.

## Technical Requirements
- **Minimum Android API**: 24 (Android 7.0) - Jetpack Compose requirement
- **Target Android API**: 35 (Android 15) - Current Google Play requirement
- **Compile Android API**: 35 (Android 15) - Aligned with target
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (primary), Traditional Views (secondary)
- **Networking**: Retrofit + OkHttp for API calls
- **Storage**: SharedPreferences for user data and experience tracking
- **Architecture**: Singleton pattern with lifecycle-aware components
- **Distribution**: Maven Central (local for now, can migrate to private later)

## API Endpoint Details
- **URL**: https://app.appero.co.uk/api/feedback

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Step 1 Complete: SDK Initialization & Configuration

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/appero_sdk_android/Appero.kt` - Main SDK singleton class
- `app/src/test/java/com/example/appero_sdk_android/ApperoTest.kt` - Unit tests for SDK initialization
- `appero-sample-android/app/src/main/java/com/appero/appero_sample_android/MainActivity.kt` - Updated with SDK integration
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` - Added Mockito dependency
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - Added Mockito test dependency

**Core Implementation Details:**

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented `Appero` object using Kotlin's `object` keyword for global access
2. **Secure Storage**: Credentials stored in SharedPreferences with dedicated keys:
   - `api_key`: Stores the API key securely
   - `client_id`: Stores the client ID securely  
   - `is_initialized`: Tracks initialization state
3. **Input Validation**: Added `require()` checks to prevent blank API keys or client IDs
4. **Context Management**: Stores application context for future SDK operations
5. **Internal API Access**: Provides internal methods for other SDK components to access stored credentials

**API Design:**
```kotlin
// Public API
Appero.start(context: Context, apiKey: String, clientId: String)
Appero.isInitialized(): Boolean

// Internal API (for other SDK components)
Appero.getApiKey(): String?
Appero.getClientId(): String?
Appero.getContext(): Context?
```

**Testing Coverage:**
- âœ… Successful initialization with valid credentials
- âœ… Exception handling for blank API key
- âœ… Exception handling for blank client ID
- âœ… SharedPreferences storage verification
- âœ… Mockito integration for isolated testing

**Sample App Integration:**
- SDK initialization in `MainActivity.onCreate()`
- Visual feedback showing initialization status
- Uses example credentials for demonstration

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Used `object` for singleton pattern (thread-safe by default in Kotlin)
- SharedPreferences for persistence (Android standard for key-value storage)
- Application context stored to prevent memory leaks
- Internal visibility for credential access methods
- Separate initialization state tracking for reliability

**Next Steps Prepared:**
- TODO comments in `initializeCoreComponents()` for future features
- Internal API ready for networking, user management, and experience tracking
- Foundation set for Flutter wrapper compatibility
