- We are building an android library (sdk)
- We are also buidling a sample android native app to test this library
- Use Kotlin
- Use Gradlew scripts to build and publish the sdk locally - no need to ask to run these
- When we change the version of the SDK we should change the version we are injecting on the sample project
